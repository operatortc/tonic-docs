# Windowed
A base class is used for creating a windowed component.

If you need to render large data sets (hundreds of thousands of rows for example), you can use a technique known as `windowing`. This technique renders a subset of your data while giving the user the impression that all the data
has been rendered.

## Demo

This demo generates the data after you click the overlay. Generating 500000 rows of data can take a second or two.

<div class="example full-width">
  <div id="click-to-load">
    <span>Click to Load</span>
  </div>
  <example-windowed id="windowed" row-height=30>
  </example-windowed>
</div>

## Code

#### HTML

```html
<example-windowed row-height=30>
</example-windowed>
```
